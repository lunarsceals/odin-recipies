    <h3>Just a well-made cheeseburger</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Seseme Seed Buns</li>
        <li>Thinly-Shaved Yellow Onion</li>
        <li>Pickle Chips</li>
        <li>Seasoned Salt</li>
        <li>Burger Sause of Choice</li>
        <li>2 Slices Yellow American Cheese</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Butter</li>
        <li>6 Ounces Ground Beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make some ground beef balls. Yes, balls haha. Now make some compact beef balls with 3 ounces or around 1/3 cup of ground beef. Really doesn't need to be precise, eat as much meat as you want, but keep it the same. Place the balls in the freezer to keep them cold but not long enough that it'll freeze. This will make them juicier when you cook them later. But remember don't freeze them. No one likes hard balls. </li>
        <li>Get some butter and heat it over medium-low heat in a skillet. Get your seseme seed burger buns and toast them with the cur side down for about 2-3 minutes. When finished, take the buns out.</li>
        <li><strong>Crank Up The Heat.</strong></li>
        <li>Put the cold burger balls in the skillet and smash them with a patty flipper. </li>
        <li>Season the patties nicely. Then, put the shaved onions on top on the patties.</li>
        <li>After approximently 2 minutes of searing have passed, flip the patties on the onion side. </li>
        <li>Add the good-ol' american cheese slices. </li>
        <li> While the cheese melts, add your pickles to the bottom bun and your burger sauce of choice on the top bun.</li>
        <li>Take the patties off the skillet once they are done and stack that shit on the burger.</li>
    </ol>
    <p> Now you got a really damn good cheeseburger. Enjoy.</p>
